# Mini Vulkan Game Engine

A small, modern **C++20** game engine built from scratch using **Vulkan**.  
This project is designed as a showcase of clean C++ design, modern graphics programming techniques, and Vulkan best practices — while staying minimal and easy to understand.


---

## ✨ Features (WIP)

- ✅ **Modern C++20** with RAII wrappers for Vulkan objects  
- ✅ Clean **CMake build system** (cross-platform: Windows & Linux)  
- ✅ Basic render pipeline (triangle, cube)  
- 🔄 Texture loading and descriptor sets  
- 🔄 Scene graph with transforms and camera system  
- 🔄 Phong/PBR lighting  
- 🔄 ImGui integration for debug UI

## 🛠 Roadmap

| Milestone | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **1. Foundation** | CMake setup, logging, Vulkan instance/device/swapchain creation | ✅ |
| **2. Basic Renderer** | Vertex/index buffers, shaders, single pipeline, draw a triangle/cube | ✅ |
| **3. Resource Management** | Uniform buffers, descriptor sets, texture uploads | ⏳ |
| **4. Scene System** | Scene graph or ECS, transform updates, camera system | ⏳ |
| **5. Input + Game Loop** | GLFW/SDL integration, delta time, fixed update loop | ⏳ |
| **6. Showcase Feature** | PBR lighting or ImGui debug overlay | ⏳ |
| **7. Polish & Docs** | Benchmarks, unit tests, full documentation | ⏳ |
